H1 Start en endcodes in Polarcloud
For my printer Adventurer3 these codes are pre-defined in Polarcloud (https://polar3d.com/)
Startcode:
xgcode 1.0 ;start gcode
M140 S {TEMPBED} ; Temperature to set the platform to, in degrees C
M104 S {TEMP0} T0 ; Temperature to set the toolhead to  T0 default or T1 
M104 S0 T1 ; Set second toolhead to 0 degrees C non existent in Adventurer 3
M107 ; Disable cooling fan
G90 ; All coordinates from now on are absolute relative to the origin of the machine
G28 ; Move to the home position
M132 X Y Z A B ; Load current home position from EEPROM
G1 Z50.00 F400 ; Move to pos Z50 at feedrate F400
G161 X Y F3300 ; unknown
M6 T0 ; Wait for the toolhead to reach target temperature
M907 X100 Y100 Z40 A80 B20 ; Set digital potentiometer value 
M108 T0 ; Set toolhead to T0
G1 Z.20 F400 ; Move to pos Z0.20 at feedrate F400

endcode:
M140 S0 : Set the platform to 0 degrees C
M104 S0 T0 ; Set toolhead to 0 degrees C
G28 X Y ; Move to home position
M132 X Y Z A B ; Load current home position from EEPROM
G91 ; All coordinates from now on are relative to the last position
M18 ; disable stepper motors all axes

Note:  The print results in Polarcloud have been good so far.
The {} may mean that the value from the setting of the profile is assumed. Polarcloud creates the slice itself, or processes a strange gcode file; in that case, the temperature instructions are already set with the controller prior to the start of the print job. Earlier I found that a certain gcode that apparently did not contain the correct temperature instructions was processed at the set temperature.
